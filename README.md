# Kleptocracy Files

This repository houses research into the possibility of kleptocratic capture in the United States. It organizes public source material into a searchable timeline, narrative posts, and a casebook of primary documents.

## Repository layout
- `timeline/` – YAML events with metadata, tags, and source citations.
- `posts/` – Narrative essays and playbooks that expand on timeline events.
- `casebook/` – Tools and data for ingesting and cataloging primary source PDFs.
- `scripts/` – Maintenance scripts and quality-assurance reports.

## Getting Started
1. Browse the `timeline/` directory for chronological event files.
2. Read essays in `posts/` for thematic analysis.
3. Review `PROJECT_EVAL.md` for project status and open questions.

## Changelog
