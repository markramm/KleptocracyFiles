# Debugging Democracy #25: Future‑Proofing — Hardening the Constitution’s “Control Plane”
*Reforms that target the exact failure modes we’ve been tracking*

This is not a theory list; it’s a **bugfix backlog** tied to observable failures.

## 1) Emergency powers & the Insurrection Act
- **Clarify triggers, scope, and duration**, require transparent findings, and mandate **congressional review** for extensions. Brennan Center and CRS have concrete proposals and statutory analyses. [1][2]  
- Require **geographic specificity** and **sunsets** for domestic deployments; bind courts to **expedited merits** after stays so “temporary” doesn’t become “indefinite.”

## 2) Procedural stays reform
- Appellate courts granting stays should set **strict briefing clocks** and **automatic status conferences**; Congress can authorize **statutory fast‑track** for cases with ongoing rights deprivations. (Compare special‑statute review acts.) [3]

## 3) Budget law teeth
- Give GAO **enforceable remedies** for Impoundment Control Act violations (e.g., automatic injunctive relief or payment mandates) when agencies ignore lawful opinions. [4][5]

## 4) Press access guarantees
- Codify **viewpoint‑neutral press access** standards for the executive branch; require any pool redesign to be **public, consultative, and reviewable**. Use RCFP model policies and recent AP litigation outcomes as scaffold. [6][7]

## 5) Platform transparency
- Require **public, machine‑readable changelogs** for policies impacting civic information (downranking, labeling, ad access); mandate **researcher APIs** with privacy‑protective sampling for election periods. (See EU DSA analogues.) [8][9]
