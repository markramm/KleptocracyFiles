# Debugging Democracy #21: Week 3 System Status — Critical Alerts
*Real‑time assessment of democratic infrastructure (as of 2025-08-11)*

**Overall:** **Critical**. Redundancy continues to collapse into single control planes; information integrity guardrails are weakened; rollback mechanisms are constrained by procedural stays.

## New this week
- **Information integrity degraded**: Meta’s fact‑checking sunset is underperforming replacement; California’s deepfake law blocked; federal AI rulemaking remains slow. [1][2][3][4][5][6]  
- **Restore points compromised**: IG/OGE removals stand; GAO impoundment findings met with non‑compliance; press pool redesign undercuts court‑ordered AP access. [7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16]  
- **Procedural stays normalize exceptions**: Ninth Circuit stay preserves LA deployment; SCOTUS stay sustains pre‑rule status quo in EPA case. [17][18]

## Safeguards that held
- Courts **retain jurisdiction**—e.g., Ninth Circuit rejected claims of unreviewability even while granting a stay. [17]  
- Transparency via **GAO opinions**, **press litigation**, and **public EAVS data** continues to surface facts. [9][14][19]

## Safeguards failing or at risk
- **Verification latency** widening (platform policies + lack of deepfake labeling). [1][3][4]  
- **Budget‑law enforcement** lacking immediate teeth; compliance delayed or ignored. [9][10]  
- **Emergency stays** routinely maintain contested actions. [17][18]

## Monitoring priorities (next 7 days)
- Track filings on **D.C. surge** and any TROs/stays.  
- Build a **verification‑latency dashboard** (claim timestamp → correction reach) for high‑salience narratives.  
- Publish **press‑pool change diff** and map seating/rotation impacts.  
- Watch for **copy‑paste** of California deepfake ruling in other circuits or in statehouses.
