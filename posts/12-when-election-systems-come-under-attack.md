# Debugging Democracy #12: When Election Systems Come Under Attack
*Ballot access and certification under pressure (funding, process, and prosecutions)*

## 1) Capacity squeeze: bans on private election funding + federal cuts
As of mid‑2025, **29 states** now **prohibit or restrict** private funding of election administration (“Zuckerbucks”), according to the **National Conference of State Legislatures**.¹ Meanwhile, a **July 2025 Brennan Center survey** found **60%** of local election officials worried about **federal cuts to election‑security services**.² The **EAC’s 2024 EAVS** (released **June 30, 2025**) documents continuing administrative load growth—mail ballots, early voting, and tech requirements—without commensurate resources.³ ⁴

**Effect:** do more with less, and don’t accept private help—**designed fragility**.

## 2) Targeted friction: mass voter‑challenge pipelines
**Georgia’s SB 189 (2024)** eased third‑party challenges to voter eligibility; the **Brennan Center** warned it invites **bogus mass challenges** that drain official time and force voters to defend their status.⁵ ⁶

## 3) Certification as hostage: Cochise County, AZ
After **Cochise County** supervisors refused to certify the **2022** election, **Peggy Judd** pled guilty to a **misdemeanor** in Oct. **2024**; **Tom Crosby’s** felony case continues into **2025** with trial dates slipping.⁷ ⁸ ⁹ This remains a live test of whether local officials can **weaponize certification** without swift consequences.

## 4) Disenfranchisement by design: Ohio’s surge in rejected ballots
**All Voting Is Local** reports **~34,000 rejected ballots** in **Ohio’s 2024** election—a sharp rise after ID and process changes in **HB 458** (2023).¹⁰
