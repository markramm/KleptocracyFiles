# Debugging Democracy #22: Rapid Response Playbook (v2)
*How to analyze breaking events within 4 hours — with tooling that holds up in court and in public*

When something breaks — a sudden deployment, a press-access lockout, a fast-moving rule — we need a repeatable response that produces **verifiable artifacts**, not just hot takes. This is the updated 4‑hour playbook we’ll use for Week 4 and beyond.

## 0) Safety & legal ground rules (0–15 min)
- Make sure on‑the‑ground volunteers know **press/protest rights** and constraints; identify a lawyer hotline in advance. [1][2][3][4]  
- If filming, capture **context + continuity** (street corners, clock faces, cross‑angles) and **preserve originals** off device ASAP. [5]

## 1) What happened (15–60 min)
- Write a **neutral, technical description**: who, what, where, when, under what claimed authority.  
- Snapshot **primary sources** (orders, memos, press releases) into the **Internet Archive** and save hash digests with a provenance note. [6]  
- Establish a **ground truth log**: each item has a timestamp, link to raw evidence, and a status (confirmed / likely / disputed).

## 2) Systems impact (30–90 min)
- Identify **infrastructure dependencies** implicated (platform throttles, telecom, cloud, credentialing).  
- Note what **public services** are affected (transit, courts, public records, emergency rooms), and where to pull their status pages into the log.

## 3) Attack pattern (60–120 min)
- Map the event to a known pattern (press‑access throttling; emergency‑stay end‑runs; budget impoundment; platform downranking). Link to **comparables** in the timeline folder.

## 4) Cascade risk (90–150 min)
- List **next likely failures** (e.g., geofence warrants after mass arrests; stay applications after an adverse district ruling). Include prior cases from 2024–2025 (Week 1–3 posts).

## 5) Monitoring points (150–240 min)
- Define **checklist metrics** (e.g., “verification latency” in minutes; arrests per hour; proportion of **clearly identified** journalists injured or detained). [7][8]  
- Build a lightweight **evidence bundle**: timeline, exhibits (PDFs/images with hashes), and an executive summary that a newsroom or court can read in 5 minutes.
