# Debugging Democracy #16: The Compliance Theater Problem
*When oversight exists, but only as performance*

In high-stakes systems, “compliance” can become a box-checking ritual that masks risk. This isn’t theoretical—it's what we’re watching in real time.

## Ethics: the five-year term that lasted 56 days
On **Feb 10, 2025**, the White House removed Office of Government Ethics (OGE) Director **David Huitema**, despite a five‑year term. OGE’s own website acknowledged the removal and reversion to an acting director. The episode wasn’t just personnel—it signaled practical subordination of an independent control function. [1][2][3][4]

## Anti-corruption: enforcement “paused,” then rewritten
Also on **Feb 10**, an Executive Order **paused FCPA enforcement for 180 days** and directed DOJ to rewrite guidance. The White House published a fact sheet; legal trade press and Reuters confirmed the pause. DOJ later issued June guidelines signaling a narrowed focus and de facto end of the full pause. Compliance continued—only the incentives changed. [5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12]

## Universities: settlement monitoring as leverage
By **July 23–24**, **Columbia University** agreed to a **$200M** settlement with federal agencies, plus **$21M** to the EEOC, alongside policy commitments and monitoring that reach deep into campus governance. California officials, facing a **$1B** demand tied to **UCLA** and frozen grants, called the tactics “political extortion.” Whatever one’s view of the underlying disputes, the mechanism is familiar to engineers: **budget control becomes a policy control plane**. [13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20]

## Press access: formal rights, functional throttling
A district court ordered AP access restored on **Apr 8**; a week later, a “press pool” redesign diminished the very outlet the order benefited. The WHCA warned the changes would hinder independent reporting. On paper, access was “restored.” In practice, capacity was throttled. [21][22][23]

**Bottom line**: Oversight that can be fired, funding that can be frozen, pools that can be reconfigured, and laws that can be “paused” aren’t safeguards—they’re dashboards for whoever holds the keys.
