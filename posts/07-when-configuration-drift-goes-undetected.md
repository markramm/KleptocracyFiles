# Debugging Democracy #7: When Configuration Drift Goes Undetected

*Regulatory capture through procedural changes*

In software, **configuration drift** accumulates through **tickets, toggles, and “temporary” patches**. In governance, it accrues via **executive orders, guidance memos, and emergency stays**—often outside the glare of full rulemaking.

- **Ratio rules**: The U.S. experimented with **“2‑for‑1” deregulation** under **EO 13771 (2017)**—later **rescinded by EO 13992 (2021)**—illustrating how **ratio‑based constraints** can reshape agency behavior without legislation. [^eo13771] [^eo13992]  
- **Guidance over rules**: Agencies increasingly rely on **guidance memos** and **enforcement discretion** (e.g., DHS and DOT 2024–2025 memos; EPA PFAS guidance) that have **immediate operational effects** while avoiding full notice‑and‑comment. [^dhs-guidance-2025] [^dot-enforcement] [^epa-pfas] [^doj-guidance]  
- **Emergency stays**: As shown in **Ohio v. EPA (2024)** and **L.A. deployment (2025)**, **stays** can become **policy by default**, preserving contested actions for months or longer. [^ohio-epa] [^9th-stay]

The net effect: **policy drift** that meaningfully **reconfigures systems** without sustained public debate or congressional votes.
