# Debugging Democracy #24: Resistance Documentation — What Works (and What Breaks)
*How to document abuses so they can’t be ignored or erased*

## 1) Build evidence that survives
- **Dual-chain storage**: publish to a newsroom/NGO and to a public archive with **immutable hash** (e.g., Internet Archive; Git repo with signed tags). [1][2]  
- **Content provenance**: adopt **C2PA** or **sigstore** for official releases so adversaries can’t spoof your org’s statements. [3][4]

## 2) Structure your field notes
- For each incident: **timestamp**, location (GPS + visible markers), actors (uniform markings, unit numbers), actions (quote speech acts precisely), and **media IDs** (file hashes).  
- Avoid leading language; **quote and show**. Use WITNESS and RCFP guides for formats that hold up in court. [5][6]

## 3) Anticipate platform throttles
- Assume political content **won’t be recommended by default** on Instagram/Threads; budget for paid reach if mission‑critical. [7]  
- Expect slower/partial coverage on crowd‑notes systems for complex claims; **publish your primary docs** alongside claims so verifiers can replicate. [8]

## 4) Legal & safety scaffolding
- Coordinate with **NLG legal observers**; pre‑print hotline cards; know local **press‑police protocols**. [9][10]
