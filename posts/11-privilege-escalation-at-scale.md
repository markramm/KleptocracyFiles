# Debugging Democracy #11: Privilege Escalation at Scale
*When state preemption and federal override become a permissions model*

Security folks know “privilege escalation”: exploit a weak control to gain broader access. In 2024–25, two parallel tracks showed how **governments escalate privilege across layers**—from states preempting locals to the federal executive overriding states—often preserved by **emergency stays**.

## Track A — State preemption on immigration: Texas SB 4
On **March 19, 2024**, the **U.S. Supreme Court** allowed **Texas SB 4** (state‑level immigration criminalization) to take effect **temporarily** pending appeal; within a day, the Fifth Circuit re‑blocked it and heard argument.¹ ² ³ The whiplash illustrates how emergency orders can **swing operational control** over immigration enforcement within hours, even as merits are unresolved.⁴

**Why it matters:** preemption doctrine traditionally makes **immigration federal**, but the emergency‑docket sequence let a state policy briefly alter on‑the‑ground arrests and detentions—with downstream harm even if later stayed.

## Track B — Federal override of states: Los Angeles deployment
In **June 2025**, a district court held the **federalization of California’s National Guard** and the **use of active‑duty Marines** in Los Angeles likely unlawful—yet a **Ninth Circuit stay** quickly restored federal control while the appeal proceeds.⁵ ⁶ ⁷ Media and court summaries emphasize that the panel both (a) signaled likely government success on statutory grounds and (b) rejected the administration’s claim that its actions were **beyond judicial review**.⁶ ⁷

**Why it matters:** the stay turned a contested, time‑sensitive deployment into the **status quo**—a live example of how procedural relief can function as a **permanent authorization** during the period that matters most.

## Design lesson
When **emergency stays** are the dominant control surface, the system defaults to **whoever can act first**. That’s a dangerous permissions model for democratic infrastructure.
