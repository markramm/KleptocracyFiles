# Debugging Democracy #27: Project 2025 Blueprint in Action
*Tracking the blueprint behind the administration's first moves*

**Project 2025** offers a 920-page manual for consolidating presidential control and reshaping federal agencies. The Heritage Foundation published the plan in April 2023, anticipating a second Trump term.[^proj2025]

On **January 20, 2025**, the administration issued the "Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions," revoking 78 Biden-era directives.[^initial] Within the next day, proclamations declared national emergencies at the southern border[^border] and across the energy sector,[^energy] expanding executive authority in both areas. Four days into the term, *Time* reported that nearly two-thirds of the administration's early executive actions mirrored proposals from Project 2025.[^time]
