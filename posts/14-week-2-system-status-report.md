# Debugging Democracy #14: Week 2 System Status Report
*Infrastructure health assessment as of August 11, 2025*

**Overall state:** **Degraded and normalizing**. Emergency deployments and settlement‑driven governance are **hardening** into standing posture while legal merits lag.

## What changed this week
- **D.C. surge** established: federal patrols expanded; **~120 FBI agents** on street duty; Guard activation prepared.¹ ² ³  
- **University settlement model** scaled: Columbia’s **monitor‑enforced** deal set a template; UCLA saw a **$1B demand** amid a broad research freeze; AP spotlighted Harvard freeze impacts.⁴ ⁵ ⁶ ⁷  
- **Elections capacity warning lights:** NCSL confirms **29 states** with private‑funding limits; Brennan Center’s survey flags **federal support cuts**; EAC’s **EAVS** shows persistent workload growth.⁸ ⁹ ¹⁰  
- **Surveillance posture**: USCIS **social‑media** adjudications live; State **expanded online vetting**; DHS **NTAS** remains elevated.¹¹ ¹² ¹³  

## Safeguards that held
- Courts **retained review** over L.A. deployment even while granting a stay (panel rejected “unreviewable” claim).¹⁴  
- Active litigation continues over **certification abuses** (Cochise County).¹⁵

## Safeguards that failed or are failing
- **Emergency stays** functionally preserve contested deployments and policies during the operative period.¹⁴  
- **Budget/settlement leverage** is overriding campus self‑governance.

## New vulnerabilities
- **Function creep** in D.C.: once Guard activated, roles may expand beyond logistics.  
- **Replicable campus template:** monitors + policy mandates tied to funding restoration.  
- **Election administration fragility:** more workload, less resourcing, no private backfill.

## Next week’s monitoring priorities
- Track any **TROs / injunctions** against D.C. surge tactics and whether **stays** issue.  
- Publish a **settlement‑terms diff** (Columbia vs. any new campus agreements).  
- Build **dashboard** from EAVS + local staffing data to surface county capacity bottlenecks.
