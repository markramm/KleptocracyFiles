# Debugging Democracy #20: The Backup Strategy Problem
*What happens when restore points are compromised*

Production systems survive because we plan for **rollback**. In democracies, “rollback” lives in **IGs, ethics offices, courts, press access, and budget law**. In 2025, many of those **restore points** were altered or disabled.

## 1) Oversight backups removed
- **Inspectors General**: On **Jan. 24–25, 2025**, **~17 IGs** were purged **without the 30‑day notice** the law requires. CIGIE called the removals legally insufficient; bipartisan senators demanded explanations. [1][2][3][4]  
- **OGE**: On **Feb. 10, 2025**, the White House **removed the OGE Director** mid‑term; OGE publicly noted it would revert to an acting director. [5][6][7]

## 2) Budget‑law backups bypassed
- **GAO** issued Impoundment Control Act decisions in **May** (NEVI EV chargers) and **Aug** (NIH grants) finding **unlawful withholding**. Rather than remediate, agencies were told to **ignore** GAO while appropriation cuts to GAO were floated. [8][9][10]

## 3) Judicial rollback stuck behind stays
- **Los Angeles deployment**: A district court found elements **likely unlawful**; the **Ninth Circuit** stayed the order, preserving the deployment during appeal. [11][12]  
- **Ohio v. EPA**: SCOTUS stayed the **Good Neighbor Plan**, halting a major rule pending litigation. [13]

## 4) Press access: formal win, functional loss
- **AP ban lifted** by court (**Apr. 8**), but on **Apr. 15** the White House **restructured the press pool** and cut the permanent wire slot—legal win, operational throttle. [14][15][16]

**Engineering lesson:** If your backups are controlled by the same actor who can trigger failures, you don’t have backups—you have **single‑party control**.
