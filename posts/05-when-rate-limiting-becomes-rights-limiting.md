# Debugging Democracy #5: When Rate Limiting Becomes Rights Limiting

*Civil liberties under systematic constraint*

When systems throttle throughput, users feel it as **latency**. When governments do it, people feel it as **rights** getting harder to exercise.

## Interior Arrest Quotas as “Throughput Targets”

In May–August 2025, senior officials repeatedly signaled a **target of ~3,000 immigration arrests per day**—a number echoed in court filings and media briefings before DOJ began to walk it back under judicial scrutiny. [^reuters-mar4] [^reuters-jun10] [^reuters-jun13] [^politico-aug3] [^reuters-aug7] [^reuters-aug2] Even without a formal “quota,” the operational effect is the same: **pressure** yields **overbroad sweeps**, **profiling**, and **due‑process shortcuts**—and courts in California began issuing orders to curb tactics like **“roving” raids** and stops based on language or workplace.

## Visa Revocations as Authentication Attacks

Universities reported **visa revocations** tied to campus protest activity, with foreign students **detained**, **questioned**, or **removed**—a chilling effect on speech that mirrors an **authentication layer** weaponized against unpopular traffic.

## Geofence Warrants and the Perimeter Problem

In **Aug. 2024**, the **Fifth Circuit** held that broad **geofence warrants** are **unconstitutional general warrants**, while other courts have been more permissive—leaving a **patchwork perimeter** where a single tool can be lawful in one circuit and unlawful in another. [^5th-geofence] [^georgetown-geofence] That kind of inconsistency is a classic **architecture smell**: it encourages **forum shopping** and erodes predictable rights.
