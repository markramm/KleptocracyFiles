# Debugging Democracy #15: When Redundancy Becomes a Single Point of Failure
*How distributed systems get centralized in practice*

In healthy systems, redundancy prevents catastrophic failure. In captured systems, the appearance of redundancy hides the fact that all roads route through one or two chokepoints. Week 3 opens with a simple claim: America’s democratic “multi-cloud” isn’t. We’ve converged on a handful of private and procedural control planes—so when one goes sideways, everything does.

## The illusion of multi-provider resilience
- **Starlink outage as a warning**. In late July 2025, a global Starlink outage knocked thousands of users offline across multiple regions. Even with other providers available, the dependency graph was clear: a single constellation failure rippled through critical comms and small ISPs that lean on Starlink backhaul. Treat this as the postmortem you hope you never write for public infrastructure. [1][2][3]

- **Federal “multi-cloud,” single control plane**. GSA’s OneGov Cloud program secured roughly **$1B** in AWS cloud credits and services for agencies. The pitch is modernization; the risk is concentration (credits, migrations, and tooling incentives drive de facto single-vendor gravity). Over time, redundancy collapses into one control plane—identity, billing, IAM. [4][5][6]

- **Information layer centralization**. For news and civic information, a few private platforms dominate discovery and distribution. In 2024, Pew and the Reuters Institute both documented that a large share of U.S. adults routinely get news via social feeds (and increasingly from video-first apps). When those feeds downrank politics or privilege pay-to-play accounts, “redundant” channels converge on the same gatekeepers. [7][8]

## Procedural chokepoints masquerading as checks
- **Press pool “resilience” became a single point of failure**. After a federal judge ordered the White House to restore AP access on **April 8, 2025**, the administration announced a “shake-up” of the press pool on **April 15**. The White House Correspondents’ Association warned the changes undermine independent coverage. Structurally, one office reconfigured the switchboard most outlets rely on. [9][10][11]

- **Emergency stays as an always-on bypass**. District courts sometimes halt unlawful actions; appellate stays then preserve the contested status quo for months. Think of it as a circuit breaker failing open. The Supreme Court’s stay of EPA’s Good Neighbor Plan is one example of procedural tools preserving pre-stay behavior; in Los Angeles, a district judge deemed elements of the deployment unlawful, yet a Ninth Circuit stay kept forces in place during appeal. [12][13][14]

## Takeaway for engineers
If you wouldn’t accept a corporate network where three vendors and one procedural override can brick core services, don’t accept it for democracy. Redundancy without independence is a single point of failure in disguise.
