# Debugging Democracy #13: The Metadata Attack
*Surveillance infrastructure expansion and unsettled doctrine*

## 1) Social‑media screening formalized
- **USCIS (Apr. 9, 2025)** announced it will consider **social‑media “antisemitic activity”** in immigration benefit decisions, immediately affecting green cards and student categories.¹ Major press confirmed scope and civil‑liberties concerns.²  
- **State Department (Jun. 18, 2025)** announced **expanded screening and vetting** for visa applicants, including review of applicants’ **online presence**.³ Civil‑society analysis warned the policy is **vague** and conflicts with DHS’s prior rules.⁴  
- Research groups note DHS also runs **Continuous Immigration Vetting**, automating post‑entry monitoring with social‑media inputs.⁵

**System effect:** screening shifts from specific security indicators to **ongoing content adjudication**—blurring immigration control with speech policing.

## 2) Geofence warrants: split circuits
- **Fifth Circuit (Aug. 9, 2024)**: in *United States v. Smith*, held that **geofence warrants are categorically unconstitutional** as modern **general warrants**, while allowing evidence under the **good‑faith exception**.⁶ ⁷ ⁸  
- **Fourth Circuit & Colorado Supreme Court** have been more permissive, creating a **patchwork**; **CRS** flagged the conflict in May **2025**.⁹ ¹⁰

**System effect:** lawful in some jurisdictions, suppressed in others—**forum shopping** and uncertainty persist.

## 3) Protest‑adjacent threat framing
DHS’s **National Terrorism Advisory** (Jun. 22, 2025) continues an elevated posture tied to geopolitical conflict and domestic mobilization risks, underscoring how **threat frameworks** can bleed into **policing of assemblies** when paired with expanded intel sharing through **fusion centers**.¹¹ ¹²
