# Debugging Democracy #4: When Your Load Balancers Fail Over to Authoritarianism

*Press access control and information throttling*

**Feb. 11, 2025:** The White House **barred Associated Press journalists** from the Oval Office and Air Force One over AP’s refusal to use “Gulf of America” instead of **Gulf of Mexico**. [^ap-statement] [^ap-block] [^ap-pbs] Officials said they had the **“right to punish”** AP. [^ap-right-to-punish] A judge later ordered **AP access restored** (Apr. 8), but within days the White House **restructured the press pool**, eliminating the wire services’ permanent slot—**technical compliance, systemic circumvention**. [^ap-injunction] [^politico-pool] [^whca-pool] [^pftracker]

On the streets, journalists covering federal operations in **Los Angeles** reported injuries from **less‑lethal munitions**, prompting court orders protecting clearly identified press. (Case reporting summarized here.)

This is what a **load balancer** configured for **throttling** looks like in the information system: **deny or degrade** the fast, factual wire feed; **favor paid or partisan channels**; add **friction** to independent reporting.
