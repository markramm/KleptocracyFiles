# Debugging Democracy #3: When Circuit Breakers Become Amplifiers

*Emergency judicial procedures protecting executive overreach*

Courts are supposed to be **circuit breakers**—they trip when something’s wrong. In **2024–2025**, emergency judicial tools increasingly did the opposite: **preserved** contested actions while appeals dragged on.

- In **Ohio v. EPA** (Jun. 27, 2024), the Supreme Court **stayed** the Good Neighbor Plan, halting a major air‑quality rule pending litigation. [^ohio-epa]  
- In **SEC v. Jarkesy** (Jun. 27, 2024), the Court funneled more enforcement into **jury trials**, pushing bottlenecks into already‑overloaded courts. [^jarkesy]  
- In **Loper Bright v. Raimondo** (Jun. 28, 2024), the Court **overruled Chevron**, expanding judicial discretion over agency interpretations. [^loper]  
- In **Murthy v. Missouri** (Jun. 26, 2024) and **FDA v. AHM** (Jun. 13, 2024), the Court disposed of high‑salience disputes on **standing**, limiting who can sue. [^murthy] [^ahm]

By **June 2025**, stays became the **operational authorization** for domestic deployments: a district judge called the **L.A. Marine/Guard deployment** likely unlawful, but the **Ninth Circuit’s emergency stay** kept it in place. [^breyer-order] [^9th-stay] When a stay **maintains the contested action**, the court becomes a **clutch**—letting the engine spin while the wheels keep turning.
