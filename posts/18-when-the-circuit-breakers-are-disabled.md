# Debugging Democracy #18: When the Circuit Breakers Are Disabled
*Courts as failed safeguards*

Engineers add circuit breakers so failures fail **safe**. In 2025, emergency judicial procedures frequently failed **open**—preserving contested executive actions while litigation crawled.

## The stay machine
- **EPA “Good Neighbor Plan”**: The Supreme Court stayed EPA’s interstate ozone rule, sustaining the pre‑stay status quo and limiting immediate relief for downwind states. Whatever you think of the merits, this is the pattern: shadow‑docket stays that function as long‑running policy. [1]

- **Los Angeles deployments**: On **June 12, 2025**, a district judge found aspects of the Los Angeles deployment likely unlawful. Within hours, the **Ninth Circuit** issued an emergency stay. Result: Guard and Marines remained on the streets as the appeal unfolded. [2][3]

- **Texas SB4 immigration law**: Cycles of enjoinments and stays repeatedly reactivated and re‑suspended the law, moving the operating reality faster than merits decisions could land. This is the playbook. [4][5]

## Press as canary
By **July 10–11**, a federal court issued a **TRO barring LAPD from using “less‑lethal” munitions against clearly identified journalists**. The order was necessary because dozens of journalists had already been shot with projectiles or obstructed during protest coverage. Even here, relief was bounded—city-only; LAPD-only; time‑limited. [6][7][8][9][10]

## The engineering read
A system with circuit breakers stuck **open** isn’t resilient—it’s brittle. If we want courts to work like safety systems, emergency relief must actually **reduce** risk while merits are decided.
