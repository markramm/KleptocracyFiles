# Timeline (per-event `.yaml` files)

Each significant event has its own `.yaml` file (see `_SCHEMA.json`). These are concise, neutral summaries with full URLs for citations.

## Build an index for local testing
```bash
python scripts/build_timeline_index.py
# Outputs to timeline/index.json (ignored by Git)
```
